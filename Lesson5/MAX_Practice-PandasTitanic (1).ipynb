To learn more, read here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RMS_Titanic\n","\n","Our goal today is to perform a data analysis on a subset of the passenger list. We're looking for insights as to which types of passengers did and didn't survive. Women? Children? 1st Class Passengers? 3rd class? Etc.\n","\n","I'm sure you've heard the expression often said during emergencies: \"Women and Children first\" Let's explore this data set and find out if that's true!\n","\n","Before we begin you should read up on what each of the columns mean in the data dictionary. You can find this information on this page: https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data\n","\n","\n","## Loading the data set\n","\n","First we load the dataset into a Pandas `DataFrame` variable.
