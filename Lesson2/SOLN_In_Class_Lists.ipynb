    "## The Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "**Fudgemart**, a knockoff of a company with a similar name, has hired you to create a program to browse their product catalog.\n",
    "\n",
    "Write an ipython interactive program that allows the user to select a product category from the drop-down and then displays all of the fudgemart products within that category. You can accomplish this any way you like and the only requirements are you must:\n",
    "\n",
    "- load each product from the `fudgemart-products.txt` file into a list.\n",
    "- build the  list of product catagories dynamically ( you cannot hard-code the categories in)\n",
    "- print the product name and price for all products selected\n",
    "- use ipython interact to create a drop-down for the user interface.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "FILE FORMAT:\n",
    "\n",
    " - the file `fudgemart-products.txt`  has one row per product\n",
    " - each row is delimited by a `|` character.\n",
    " - there are three items in each row. category, product name, and price.\n",
    " - Example Row: `Hardware|Ball Peen Hammer|15.99`\n",
    "   - Category = `Hardware`\n",
    "   - Product = `Ball Peen Hammer`\n",
    "   - Price = `15.99`\n",
    "\n",
    "HINTS:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Draw upon the lessons and examples in the lab and small group. We covered using interact with a dropdown, reading from files into lists, etc.\n",
    "- There is a sample file, `test-fudgemart-products.txt` which you can use to test your code and not have to deal with the number of rows in the actual file `fudgemart-products.txt`. Your code should work with either file. The test file has 3 products and 2 categories. One it works with the test file, switch to the other file!\n",
    "- The unique challenge of this homework creating the list of prodct categories. You can do this when you read the file or use the list of all products to create the categories.\n",
