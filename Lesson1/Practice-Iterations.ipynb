He would like you to improve on the program you wrote for him last week. As you may recall this program, when given an input of a student points earned in the course, would output a letter grade and grade points.\n","\n","Prof. Xavier would like the program to input multiple points earned as part of a sentinel controlled loop, and as each student total point score is entered calculate the following statistics:\n","\n","- count of student point scores in \"A\" range, and percentage of total\n","- count of student point scores in \"B\" range, and percentage of total\n","- count of student point scores in \"C\" range, and percentage of total\n","- count of student point scores in \"D\" range, and percentage of total\n","- count of student point scores in \"F\" range, and percentage of total\n","- total count of point scores entered\n","\n","NOTE: The statistics are only displayed when the command `stats` is entered.\n","\n","Once again, here is the grading scale he uses:\n","\n","    Point Range Grade Grade Points\n","    125-150     A     4.0\n","    100-124     B     3.0\n","    75-99       C     2.0\n","    50-74       D     1.0\n","    0-49        F     0.0\n","    \n","Sample Run:\n","\n","    Enter student's total points, type 'stats' or type 'quit': 130\n","    Enter student's total points, type 'stats' or type 'quit': 111\n","    Enter student's total points, type 'stats' or type 'quit': 145\n","    Enter student's total points, type 'stats' or type 'quit': stats\n","        Scores : 3\n","        A's    : 2 (66%)\n","        B's    : 1 (33%)\n","        C's    : 0 (0%)\n","        D's    : 0 (0%)\n","        F's    : 0 (0%)\n","    Enter student's total points, type 'stats' or type 'quit': 100\n","    Enter student's total points, type 'stats' or type 'quit': 60\n","    Enter student's total points, type 'stats' or type 'quit': stats\n","        Scores : 5\n","        A's    : 2 (40%)\n","        B's    : 2 (40%)\n","        C's    : 0 (0%)\n","        D's    : 1 (20%)\n","        F's    : 0 (0%)\n","    Enter student's total points, type 'stats' or type 'quit': quit\n","    Goodbye!\n","    \n","    \n","HINTS: **use problem simplification** like we did in small group and the lab!\n","\n","- Start small: just get it to count scores, then maybe A's etc.\n","- if you cannot figure out the 'stats' command, print stats each time, then try to add it afterwards.\n","\n","\n","\n","### If you want to be in the X-men you need to suck up to Prof. Xavier!!!\n","\n","Print your stats using a text-only tech bar chart, like this.
